# Hello I want to create a local ecommorce following the following user stories and developer hints and type schema below

Introduction:

this is about a local ecommerce platform called shift-market, where users can sell to other users far or near them, and buy from them as well.

Brand colors are amber-600 and slate.
App type: PWA.
App design look and feel: modern and sleek.

Below are several user stories for **shift-market**. Each story is written in two parts:  
1. **End User Perspective** – what the user (buyer or seller) experiences.  
2. **Developer Perspective** – hints, reminders, and technical tips for building the feature with React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and shadcn UI (plus suggested libraries).

## 1. Browsing as a Visitor

### End User Perspective
- **As a visitor**, I can browse the marketplace without creating an account.  
- I can search for products or services and apply intuitive filters (such as seller location or category).  
- I can click on links like `platform_url/shop_id` to jump directly to a shop’s page and explore their offerings.

### Developer Perspective
- **Routing & Data Fetching:** Use Next.js dynamic routes (e.g., `/shop/[shop_id]`) with SSR/SSG for fast, SEO-friendly pages.
- **UI & Filtering:** Leverage shadcn UI components combined with Tailwind CSS for a responsive design.  
- **Search & Filters:** Consider using a simple state management (like React’s `useState`) to handle filter changes and use utility libraries (e.g., [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)) consistently.
- **Mock API:** Create mock functions to simulate backend calls, and use toasts (e.g., [sonner](https://github.com/sonner-io/sonner)) for debugging or error messages.

## 2. Account Creation & Free Trial Ads

### End User Perspective
- **As a new user**, I first browse the site. When I decide to sell or buy, I sign up.
- After account creation, I automatically receive **3 free trial ads** to get started.
- I can later view how many free trial ads remain and understand when I need to purchase additional ad slots.

### Developer Perspective
- **Form Validation:** Build the signup form in React using TypeScript, and consider using [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for schema validation.
- **ID Generation:** Use [nanoid](https://github.com/ai/nanoid) to generate unique user or profile IDs.
- **State & UX:** Update the UI (via shadcn UI components) to display the current trial ads count from the `Profile` schema.
- **Mock API:** Use a mock function for signup API calls and simulate success/error states using toast notifications.

---

## 3. Shop Creation and Setup

### End User Perspective
- **As a shop owner**, after signing up, I can create my shop by providing a name, logo, description, and location.
- I see details like the number of ads allowed, pricing per ad (e.g., $1 per ad per month), and ad duration (with units) clearly, even if some of this meta data is used only for backend logic.
- My shop page showcases my profile and rating, ensuring buyers trust my listings.

### Developer Perspective
- **Multi-Step Forms:** Create a guided shop creation process using React components. Consider breaking the form into steps (profile, shop details, payment details).
- **Data Mapping:** Use the provided `Shop` type to ensure all required fields (like `ads_count`, `ads_duration`, `price_per_ad`, etc.) are captured.
- **UI/UX Consistency:** Use Tailwind CSS classes to ensure forms are responsive, and include tooltips or hints for fields that might be confusing.
- **Mock Submission:** Implement a mock API call to simulate shop creation, and log responses via toasts.

## 4. Creating a Product Ad

### End User Perspective
- **As a seller**, I can list a new product by creating an ad.  
- I provide product details (name, description, price, images, category, variants, etc.), and associate it with my shop.
- I can choose to promote my ad (for extra visibility), which shows me additional options like promotion duration and cost.

### Developer Perspective
- **Form Design:** Build a dynamic form for ad creation using React and shadcn UI form components.  
- **Schema Integration:** Map fields to the `Ad` and `Product` types. Make sure to include the meta data fields (`ad_lifetime`, `promotion_cost`, etc.) for pricing logic.
- **Client-Side Validation:** Use zod for validating inputs (e.g., valid price, proper image URLs).
- **Animations & Feedback:** Utilize Framer Motion for subtle animations during transitions or form submission, and use toasts for success/error feedback.

---

## 5. Ad Expiry & Promotion Payment Flow

### End User Perspective
- **As a seller**, my ad is active for a specific lifetime (e.g., 30 days).  
- When my free trial ads run out or my ad expires, I’m prompted to pay (e.g., $1 per ad per month) to continue having it visible.
- I can choose to promote my ad to increase its visibility, with clear details on promotion cost and duration.

### Developer Perspective
- **Countdown & Expiry:** Display a countdown timer for the ad’s lifetime using React state and possibly a timer hook.
- **Payment Flow:** Integrate mock functions for payment (simulate Payment and Order creation using the `Payment` and `Order` types) and use toast notifications to mimic real-time feedback.
- **Promotion Options:** Create UI components to allow users to toggle ad promotion and select promotion duration. Consider integrating react-icons for visual cues.
- **Logic Separation:** Keep pricing logic (e.g., calculating ad expiry, promotion cost) in helper functions, making future backend integration easier.

## 6. Product Search & Filtering

### End User Perspective
- **As a buyer**, I can search and filter listings by criteria such as category, price range, or seller’s location.
- I receive an intuitive, responsive search experience with clear results that update as I refine filters.
- I can directly click on a shop link or a product ad to see more details.

### Developer Perspective
- **Search Implementation:** Use Next.js API routes or mock functions to handle search queries. Implement simple client-side filtering using React state.
- **UI Components:** Utilize shadcn UI components for dropdowns, input fields, and buttons. Consistently style with Tailwind.
- **Enhancements:** Consider debouncing the search input (using a library like lodash debounce) to optimize performance.
- **Routing:** Ensure that clicking on a shop or product navigates to the proper dynamic route (e.g., `/shop/[shop_id]` or `/product/[product_id]`).

---

## 7. Order Placement & Checkout

### End User Perspective
- **As a buyer**, I can add a product to my cart and proceed to checkout.
- I can see a clear summary of my order, including ad price, applied discounts, and the final total.
- I have multiple payment options (cash, mobile money, card, etc.), and I receive confirmation and updates on my order status.

### Developer Perspective
- **Order Form:** Build an order form using React that collects order details (quantity, comments, etc.) and maps to the `Order` type.
- **Validation & Calculation:** Use zod to validate order inputs and calculate totals based on `other` fields (`per_item_discount`, `order_discount`, etc.).
- **Mock Payment:** Integrate a mock payment API call that returns simulated statuses, and show real-time feedback with toasts.
- **State Management:** Consider using React context or a global state library to manage order state across pages if needed.

---

## 8. Reviews and Ratings

### End User Perspective
- **After a purchase**, I want to rate and review the ad to help other buyers make informed decisions.
- I can submit a rating (e.g., 1–5 stars) and a text review that is then displayed on the product or service page.
- This builds trust and gives feedback to sellers.

### Developer Perspective
- **Review Component:** Create a review form component that uses controlled inputs in React.
- **Mapping & Schema:** Ensure submitted reviews conform to the `Review` type. Validate the input (e.g., rating should be within 1–5).
- **UI Feedback:** Use shadcn UI components to render existing reviews, and animate new reviews with Framer Motion.
- **API Simulation:** Implement a mock function to simulate review submission and update the list of reviews in state. Use toasts to confirm submission or show errors.

By following these user stories and developer hints, you’ll create an intuitive and robust ecommerce experience for both buyers and sellers on **shift-market**. Remember to keep the user journey clear and simple, and leverage your stack’s strengths (React, Next.js, Tailwind, TypeScript, shadcn UI) along with consistent use of your chosen libraries for validation, icons, animations, and notifications.

please consider the provided types schema so much to do this right.
