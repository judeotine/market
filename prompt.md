# Hello craft me an easy to understand well curated intuitive user stories given the types schema below, considering the following instructions

Introduction:

this is about a local ecommerce platform called shift-market, where users can sell to other users far or near them, and buy from them as well.

Instructions set A:

1. users join and initially get 3 free trial ads for free, this is after they create an account but they can of course view the ecommerce before creating an account, only when they want to sell or buy is when we ask them to create an account.
2. take note how pricing works, users pay per ad a given amount and we can say i.e $1 per ad per month, and so that's why we need meta data such as duration, duration units, and ads_count on some items, but this info may not necessarily be exposed to end users it just helps us in enforcing the pricing model when a an ad expires or user is out of ads etc.
3. users can browse products with intutive search and filters including filter by seller's location, and using links such as platform_url/shop_id they can jump straight to a shop page and broswe as well stuff specific to that shop or go to main page for full exposure.


Instruction set B:

1. each user story is in 2 modes, the end user perspective i.e shop owner and customers and the junior to mid frontend developer perspective which is what the they should take of at that point, and what they should be cautious about, and be reminded that they should take simple approaches first possible and then only reach out for others if needed, leave thier perspective mostly open ended when it comes to implementation approach just give hints.
2. the frontend is to be done in react with next js 15, tailwind, typescript, and shadcn ui, so it's helpful to provide tips how the developer should go about some things leveraging this stack or other external libraries if they have to.
3. don't skip any important steps in user journey in the stories, and user experience should sound intutive as the schema richness can provide, where lacking suggest what can be clarified or improved upon.
4. for any api calling logic or backend stuff, developer can just put mock functions that can easily implement the actual backend later, but with this still he can log or use toasts for debugging and other such things as giving users feedback mimicing the actual experience.
5. the programmer can use react-icons and lucide-icons as fit but consistently, sonner for toasts, framer motion for subtle animations, zod for validation if needed, date-fns for date handling and nanoid for UUIDs if really needed.
6. programmer should not forget some nice to have pages such as signup, login, email verification, password reset, not found page etc.
7. the developer can use mock data in development, but in a way that it's easy to swap it with real data in production via api, and also in such keep their components modular as well.
